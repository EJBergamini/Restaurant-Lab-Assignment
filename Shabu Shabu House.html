For those not in the know Shabu Shabu is a cultural specialty hotpot soup from Japan. It is a soup with a very subtle light vegetable broth where diners dip fresh meats and vegetables into the broth in order to cook them. Typically the diner will dip the veggies and meat in a soy/wasabi sauce blend. At the end after you've cooked many vegetables and meat udon noodles are added. Come give it a try today!</p>
